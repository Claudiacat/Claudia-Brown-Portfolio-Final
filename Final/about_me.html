	  		Since 8th grade i've been ranked second best in the AAIS league in badminton.  I don't play competitively anymore but still like to play in my free time and teach at camp. Here is a mini lesson....
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		The correct way of holding a racquet is as simple as a FRIENDLY HANDSHAKE. Imagine the grip of the racquet as a hand approaching to shake your hand. Go ahead and hold the racquet as if you’re shaking someone’s hand.
	  	</p>
	  	<h3>
	  		Forehand Grip and Backhand Grip
	  	</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		Next thing you need to learn is the forehand and backhand grip.
	  		Basically you’ll need to use the:
	  	</p>
	  	<ul>
	  		<li>Forehand grip to hit forehand shots.</li>
	  		<li>Backhand grip to hit backhand shots.</li>
	  		<li>The forehand and backhand grip looks almost the same. There’s only one slight difference – the placement of your fingers. You’ll understand this when I explain more about these 2 badminton gripping technique below.</li>
	  	</ul>
